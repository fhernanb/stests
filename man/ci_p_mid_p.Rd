\title{Mid-p confidence interval for Binomial proportion}
\usage{
ci_p_mid_p(x, n, conf.level = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A number or a vector with the number of successes.}

\item{n}{A number or a vector with the number of trials.}

\item{conf.level}{confidence level for the returned confidence interval.
By default is 0.95.}
}
\value{
A vector with the lower and upper limits of the confidence
interval.
}
\description{
This function calculates the mid-p confidence interval for a
Binomial proportion. It is vectorized, allowing the evaluation
of single values or vectors.
}
\details{
The mid-p confidence interval adjusts the exact binomial
interval by averaging the tail probabilities of the observed value.
The limits are found by solving the following equations:

\deqn{\sum_{j=0}^{x-1} P(X = j) + 0.5 \cdot P(X = x) = \alpha / 2}

\deqn{\sum_{j=x+1}^{n} P(X = j) + 0.5 \cdot P(X = x) = \alpha / 2}

where \eqn{P(X = j)} is the binomial probability.

\examples{
# Example with a single value
ci_p_mid_p(x = 5, n = 20, conf.level = 0.95)

# Example with vectors
x_values <- c(5, 10, 15)
n_values <- c(20, 30, 40)
ci_p_mid_p(x = x_values, n = n_values, conf.level = 0.95)
